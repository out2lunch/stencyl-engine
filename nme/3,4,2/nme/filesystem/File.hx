/**
 * A File object represents a path to a file or directory. This can be an
 * existing file or directory, or it can be one that does not yet exist; for
 * instance, it can represent the path to a file or directory that you plan to
 * create.
 *
 * <p>The File class has a number of properties and methods for getting
 * information about the file system and for performing operations, such as
 * copying files and directories.</p>
 *
 * <p>You can use File objects along with the FileStream class to read and
 * write files. </p>
 *
 * <p>The File class extends the FileReference class. The FileReference class,
 * which is available in Flash<sup>®</sup> Player as well as
 * Adobe<sup>®</sup> AIR<sup>®</sup>, represents a pointer to a file, but
 * the File class adds properties and methods that are not exposed in Flash
 * Player (in a SWF running in a browser), due to security considerations.</p>
 *
 * <p>The File class includes static properties that let you reference
 * commonly used directory locations. These static properties include:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><code>File.applicationStorageDirectory</code> - a storage directory
 * unique to each installed AIR application</li>
 *   <li><code>File.applicationDirectory</code> - the read-only directory
 * where the application is installed (along with any installed assets)</li>
 *   <li><code>File.desktopDirectory</code> - the user's desktop
 * directory</li>
 *   <li><code>File.documentsDirectory</code> - the user's documents
 * directory</li>
 *   <li><code>File.userDirectory</code> - the user directory</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>These properties have meaningful values on different operating systems.
 * For example, Mac OS, Linux, and Windows each have different native paths to
 * the user's desktop directory. However, the
 * <code>File.desktopDirectory</code> property points to the correct desktop
 * directory path on each of these platforms. To write applications that work
 * well across platforms, use these properties as the basis for referencing
 * other files used by the application. Then use the
 * <code>resolvePath()</code> method to refine the path. For example, this
 * code points to the preferences.xml file in the application storage
 * directory:</p>
 *
 * <p>The application storage directory is particularly useful. It gives an
 * application-specific storage directory for the AIR application. It is
 * defined by the <code>File.applicationStorageDirectory</code> property.</p>
 *
 * <p>Do not add or remove content from the application directory (where the
 * AIR application is installed). Doing so can break an AIR application and
 * invalidate the application signature. AIR does not let you write to the
 * application directory by default, because the directory is not writable to
 * all user accounts on all operating systems. Use the application storage
 * directory to write internal application files. Use the documents directory
 * to write files that a user expects to use outside your application, such as
 * edited pictures or text files.</p>
 * 
 * @event cancel           Dispatched when a pending asynchronous operation is
 *                         canceled.
 * @event complete         Dispatched when an asynchronous operation is
 *                         complete.
 * @event directoryListing Dispatched when a directory list is available as a
 *                         result of a call to the
 *                         <code>getDirectoryListingAsync()</code> method.
 * @event ioError          Dispatched when an error occurs during an
 *                         asynchronous file operation.
 * @event securityError    Dispatched when an operation violates a security
 *                         constraint.
 * @event select           Dispatched when the user selects a file or
 *                         directory from a file- or directory-browsing dialog
 *                         box.
 * @event selectMultiple   Dispatched when the user selects files from the
 *                         dialog box opened by a call to the
 *                         <code>browseForOpenMultiple()</code> method.
